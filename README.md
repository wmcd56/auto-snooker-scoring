# auto-snooker-scoring
This repository is for a project to automate the scoring for the game of snooker.
I use a simple webcam for now, placed approximately a foot above a snooker table.
The enitre table is not in view as my camera quality is too low, however, 
I am currently developing a prototype system to demonstrate that a computer vision 
based automated scoring system is feasible.
